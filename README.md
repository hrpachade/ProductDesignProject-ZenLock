# Zen Lock – Smartphone Lockbox

A distraction-reduction phone lockbox designed and developed by a team of 4 for our concurrent engineering course. 
The goal was to create a universal, low-cost, 3D-printable lockbox that helps students and professionals 
stay focused by limiting phone usage.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Universal phone compatibility  
- Four-part assembly: box, lid, tray, lock  
- Portable, simple, and intuitive design  

## 🔍 Project Overview
1. Market research (student & young professional focus)
2. Customer need definition + market sizing
3. Benchmarking of existing “focus tools”
4. Concept generation & initial SolidWorks prototypes
5. FMEA & House of Quality testing
6. 3D-printed prototypes + user testing
7. Redesign based on feedback
8. Cost analysis (ABS injection molding)
9. Investor-style pitch

## 📁 Deliverables Included
- CAD models & STL files  
- Prototype photos  
- HOQ & FMEA  
- Cost analysis  
- Market research summary  
- Final pitch deck  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SolidWorks  
- 3D printing (PLA)  
- Excel (costing, FMEA)  
- Team-based design reviews  

## 📦 Manufacturing Recommendation
ABS injection molding for high-volume production due to durability, surface finish, and low per-unit cost.

## 👥 Team
4-person design group — responsibilities: CAD modeling, prototyping, testing, cost analysis, and pitch.
