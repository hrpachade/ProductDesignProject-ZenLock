# Zen Lock – Smartphone Lockbox

A distraction-reduction phone lockbox designed and developed by a team of 4 for our concurrent engineering course. 
The goal was to create a universal, low-cost, 3D-printable lockbox that helps students and professionals 
stay focused by limiting phone usage.

Key Features
- Universal phone compatibility  
- Four-part assembly: box, lid, tray, lock  
- Portable, simple, and intuitive design  

Project Overview
1. Market research (student & young professional focus)
2. Customer need definition + market sizing
3. Benchmarking of existing “focus tools”
4. Concept generation & initial SolidWorks prototypes
5. FMEA
6. 3D-printed prototypes + user testing
7. User Testing
8. Cost analysis (ABS injection molding for Mass Production)
9. Investor-style pitch

Deliverables Included
- CAD models & STL files  
- Prototype photos  
- FMEA
- Cost analysis  
- Final pitch deck  

Tools Used
- SolidWorks  
- 3D printing (PLA)  
- Excel (costing, FMEA)  
- Team-based design reviews  

Manufacturing Recommendation
ABS injection molding for high-volume production due to durability, surface finish, and low per-unit cost.

Team
4-person design group — responsibilities: CAD modeling, prototyping, testing, cost analysis, and pitch.
